"Next term we're going to renovate the school cafeteria. We're going to have a whole new look and feel to the place, and we're going to need a more up-to-date Point of Sale system for our cash register. For one thing, we're going to increase our selection; previously we only had sandwiches and drinks, but in the future we're going to sell things like magazines and pick-and-mix. One important aspect is that only authorised personal can use the POS, and that it's easy to find from the daily records who sold what.

We're also been advised that a database is the best way to store product details and so on, but we're probably not quite ready for that yet. Maybe in the future. For the moment we prefer to save everything in local files."  *Gymnasiechefen, ED*  


"In case you didn't know, it's important that the [right VAT tax is paid on each item](https://www.skatteverket.se/foretagochorganisationer/moms/saljavarorochtjanster/momssatspavarorochtjanster.4.58d555751259e4d66168000409.html). Some items have 25% tax, wheeras others, for example newspapers, have only 6%. Recent changes to our regulations mean that a record of daily transactions must be available on demand. The records must be in the form of a text/Excel file with a filename that reflects the date of the transactions. The amount of VAT due on each item must be apparent from these files." *Spokesperson for the Swedish Tax Authority*  

"Our last POS system was difficult to use and unintuitive. One problem was that we couldn't add new products, and that was a real hassle. Another problem that I see is that we're going to start selling things like pick-and-mix sweets -- as you know we charge on the basis of how much the sweets weight, instead of how many sweets there are. I can imagine that will be difficult to deal with. Another issue is that in the old system we could only handle cash payments. We need to be able to handle payments by card as well." *Café Employee*  

"We have supplied ED with our small business card reader. It's simple to use and all you need is a network connection. Our [technical manual is available for download](EDBankTechnicalManual.md)." *Representative from EDBank*
